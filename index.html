	<p>My interests revolve around the intersection of project management and data, with a focus on the user experience and engagement. I am particularly drawn to the principles of F.A.I.R. data and the role of metadata in creating a harmonious and efficient approach to data management.</p>
  <p>I am intrigued by the power of engaging data catalogues to promote discovery and transparency. By combining these elements in a thoughtful and strategic way, we can create a more effective and impactful approach to data-driven decision-making.</p>

		<h2>Data Science</h2>

	<em>
		<p>The ability to detect bias, motivation, and incentives is a crucial skill in today's world. Many people have corrupt motives, and understanding their intentions can help us make better decisions and protect ourselves from harm.</p>

  <h3>Why Data Science</h3>
		<p>
		The information we consume online can have a profound impact on our worldview. The use of machine learning algorithms to manipulate the flow of information we have access to is a growing concern, as it can influence our behavior in subtle and often undetected ways.
    </p>
    <p>
    One way to stay informed and aware of the influence of data manipulation is to seek out unbiased sources of information. This is where R Pubs, a free publication site for users of the R statistical programming language, comes into play. By sharing data analyses on this platform, individuals can share their findings and perspectives with a wider audience, while also contributing to a more transparent and diverse information ecosystem.
    </p>
   <p>
   In essence, our access to information can be both empowering and potentially dangerous, depending on how it is manipulated and controlled. By engaging with platforms like R Pubs and actively seeking out diverse sources of information, we can gain a more nuanced and well-rounded perspective on the world around us.

  <h3>Why Photography</h3>
		<p>I find myself drawn to capturing the essence of big cities through the lens of my camera. I particularly enjoy photographing the striking architecture that is often found in urban environments. Through my photos, I strive to capture the intricate details and textures that make these structures so captivating.<p>
		<p>You can find my work on Instagram and Pixelfed, the latter being a unique federated photography platform that offers a sense of community and intrigue. Through this platform, I am able to connect with like-minded individuals and share my vision with a broader audience. Join me on this journey and discover the beauty of urban environments through my photography.</p>

		<h2>User Experience</h2>
		
			<em>
		<p>How can we develop the ability to detect bias, motivation, and incentives? It requires a keen sense of observation, an open mind, and a willingness to look beyond surface appearances.
		</p>

  <h3>Why User Experience</h3>

		<p>My fascination with the graphical user interface and user experience of computers started at a young age with a Mac IIci. As I grew older, I became increasingly interested in how these systems could be improved to enhance user productivity and satisfaction.</p>
		
		<p>Lately, I've been delving deeper into the world of open-source software, curious about how the unique challenges and opportunities of this field impact the user experience.</p>
		
		<p>There's something mysterious and exciting about exploring this uncharted territory, and I look forward to discovering what insights and discoveries await.</p>

<h3>Example Work</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/bryanpaget"><strong>GNOME Gitlab:</strong></a>&nbsp; Occasionally, I make contributions to the GNOME project on their GitLab instance.</li>

  <h3>Why Presentations</h3>
  
		<p>I have a passion for public speaking and a desire to make a positive impact on society. I enjoy giving presentations because they can be an effective way to share information, inspire others, and create change.</p>

    <h3>A Poem About LaTeX</h3>

    <em>
    <p>
    Ink flows like a river,
    <br>As I set my words in place.
    <br>But it is not alone,
    <br>That my pen dances with grace.
    </p>
    <p>
    For in the art of typesetting,
    <br>LaTeX is my soulmate true.
    <br>Together we weave beauty,
    <br>In strokes of black and blue.
    </p>
    <p>
    With every line and curve,
    <br>Our passion grows stronger still.
    <br>For in this world of letters,
    <br>LaTeX is my heart's own will.
    </p>
    <p>
    Like a gentle breeze it moves,
    <br>Creating art with every stroke.
    <br>LaTeX, my love, forevermore,
    <br>Our bond is an unbreakable yoke.
    </p>
    <p>
    In the depths of my being,
    <br>LaTeX, you shall forever reside.
    <br>For you are the beauty and love,
    <br>In every word that I abide.
    </p>
    </em>

  <h3>Why LaTeX</h3>
		<p> LaTeX typesetting offers several advantages over Microsoft Word. Firstly, it produces higher quality documents with sharper fonts and better spacing. Secondly, it allows for easier management of large, complex documents, making it popular among academic and scientific communities. Thirdly, it is more customizable and allows for greater control over document formatting.</p>
		<p>Furthermore, LaTeX is a free (as in freedom), open-source software that runs on multiple platforms, while Microsoft Word is a proprietary software that requires a license. LaTeX also has a wide range of packages and templates available, making it easy to create documents with specific formatting requirements.</p>
		<p>In short, LaTeX is a more efficient and powerful tool for typesetting compared to Microsoft Word. I've included below some of the articles I've written and typeset in LaTeX, see for yourself!</p>
