# Bryan Paget

My interests revolve around the intersection of project management and data, with a focus on the user experience and engagement. I am particularly drawn to the principles of F.A.I.R. data and the role of metadata in creating a harmonious and efficient approach to data management.

I'd write about what F.A.I.R. data is in a relatedable way. It just means I'm interested in helping people work with their data. How to collect, store, sort, retrieve, calculate, move data from one thing to another, etc.

I am intrigued by the power of engaging data catalogues to promote discovery and transparency. By combining these elements in a thoughtful and strategic way, we can create a more effective and impactful approach to data-driven decision-making.
