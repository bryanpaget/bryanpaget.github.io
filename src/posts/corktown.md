Corktown is a historic neighborhood located in the east end of downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The area is bounded by Queen Street East to the north, Don River to the east, Gardiner Expressway to the south, and Parliament Street to the west.

The neighborhood was first settled by Irish immigrants in the early 1800s, who worked in the nearby industrial areas. The name "Corktown" is said to have originated from the fact that many of the settlers came from County Cork in Ireland.

In the late 1800s, Corktown became a hub for industry and manufacturing, with factories and warehouses dominating the landscape. The area also became home to a large number of working-class families, many of whom were of Irish descent.

Today, Corktown is a diverse and vibrant neighborhood, home to a mix of residents including artists, young professionals, and families. The area has undergone significant gentrification in recent years, with many of the old factories and warehouses being converted into trendy lofts, shops, and restaurants.

Despite this gentrification, Corktown has managed to retain much of its historic charm and character. Some of the notable landmarks in the neighborhood include the Corktown Common park, the Distillery District (a historic area that has been converted into a pedestrian-only village with shops, restaurants, and galleries), and the Cherry Beach waterfront.

Corktown is also home to many cultural events and festivals, including the Toronto Undergraduate Jazz Festival, the Toronto International Film Festival, and the Toronto Christmas Market.

Looking towards the future, Corktown is expected to continue to grow and develop, with new condominiums and mixed-use developments being planned for the area. However, there are concerns among some residents about the impact of gentrification on the neighborhood's historic character and its working-class heritage.

Overall, Corktown is a vibrant and dynamic neighborhood with a rich history and a bright future. Its unique blend of culture, history, and modern amenities make it a popular destination for both residents and visitors to Toronto.
