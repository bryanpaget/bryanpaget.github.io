It is possible that humans have experienced gender dysphoria throughout history, although the concept and language used to describe it may have varied across cultures and time periods.

The concept of gender identity as we understand it today is a relatively modern development, and the language and social structures used to describe and categorize gender have changed over time. In some cultures, individuals who did not conform to traditional gender norms may have been recognized as "two-spirit" or "third gender," and their experiences were understood in the context of cultural beliefs and practices.

In other cultures, gender non-conformity was viewed as deviant or pathological, and individuals who expressed gender variance may have faced stigma, discrimination, or violence. It is only relatively recently that Western medicine and psychology have developed a clinical diagnosis of gender dysphoria to describe the distress experienced by individuals whose gender identity differs from the sex they were assigned at birth.

In some traditional societies, there have been cultural and social roles for individuals who do not conform to typical gender norms, such as hijras in India and two-spirit people among some Native American tribes. These roles reflect an understanding of gender as a fluid and multifaceted concept that goes beyond binary categories of male and female.

In more recent times, there has been increased awareness and acceptance of diverse gender identities, which has allowed individuals to more openly express their experiences of gender dysphoria. This may be due to a variety of factors, including greater social acceptance of diverse gender identities, increased access to medical and psychological support, and greater visibility of transgender and gender-nonconforming people in media and popular culture.

In this sense, it is not that people are experiencing gender dysphoria now but not before, but rather that the social and cultural context in which gender is understood and experienced has changed over time, which has influenced how individuals express and understand their gender identity.
