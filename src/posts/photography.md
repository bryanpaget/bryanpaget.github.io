I find myself drawn to capturing the essence of big cities through the lens of my camera. I particularly enjoy photographing the striking architecture that is often found in urban environments. Through my photos, I strive to capture the intricate details and textures that make these structures so captivating.

You can find my work on Instagram and Pixelfed, the latter being a unique federated photography platform that offers a sense of community and intrigue. Through this platform, I am able to connect with like-minded individuals and share my vision with a broader audience. Join me on this journey and discover the beauty of urban environments through my photography.

Photography is much more than just capturing images of the world around us. It is the art of capturing photons, the particles of light that make up everything we see. Photography is a way of seeing the world and capturing moments in time that we may otherwise miss. In this post, we will explore the mindfulness of photography and how it can help us stay optimistic and appreciative of the beauty around us.

## Capturing Photons, Not Objects

Photography is not about capturing objects, but about capturing photons. It is about seeing the world in a different way and finding beauty in unexpected places. When we take a photograph, we are not just capturing an image, but a moment in time that will never happen again. This makes photography a unique and powerful way to capture and preserve memories.

#### The Mindfulness of Photography

Photography is also a practice of mindfulness. It requires us to be present in the moment and fully engaged with our surroundings. When we are taking a photograph, we are focused on the scene in front of us, and everything else fades away. This can be a powerful tool for reducing stress and anxiety, as we become fully absorbed in the act of taking a photo.

#### Staying Optimistic

Photography can also help us stay optimistic. When we take a photograph, we are looking for the beauty in the world. This helps us to see the positive aspects of life, even in difficult times. By focusing on the beauty around us, we can stay motivated and inspired, even when things are challenging.

#### Keeping a Beginner's Mind

Photography also requires us to keep a beginner's mind. It is important to approach each new scene with an open and curious mind, free from preconceptions and expectations. This allows us to see the world in new and unexpected ways and to capture images that are truly unique.

#### Being Open and Responsive to the Beautiful World Around Us

Photographers remind us that life is beautiful if we take the time to see it that way. By being open and responsive to the world around us, we can capture moments of beauty and joy that we may have otherwise missed. Photography encourages us to slow down and appreciate the world in a way that we may not have otherwise done.

### Example Work

In conclusion, photography is much more than just capturing images. It is about capturing moments in time and finding beauty in unexpected places. Photography encourages us to stay optimistic, keep a beginner's mind, and be open and responsive to the beautiful world around us. By practicing mindfulness and focusing on the beauty around us, we can lead happier, more fulfilling lives.
