The Buddha taught that suffering arises from attachment and clinging to a fixed sense of self, which can include identification with one's gender. Thus, the goal in Buddhism is to transcend the limitations of the self and attain liberation from suffering.

In the context of gender dysphoria, the Buddha might advise individuals to cultivate mindfulness and self-awareness, exploring the sources of their suffering and striving to develop greater acceptance and compassion for themselves and others.

Additionally, Buddhism emphasizes the importance of non-judgment and respect for all beings, regardless of their gender identity or expression. Therefore, it is likely that the Buddha would encourage treating individuals with gender dysphoria with kindness and understanding, recognizing that their experiences and struggles are valid and deserving of respect.
