# Why I Meditate

As human beings, we all have biases and prejudices. It’s a fact of life. However, the important thing is to recognize these biases and work towards overcoming them. One powerful tool for doing this is meditation.

Meditation allows us to become more aware of our thoughts and feelings. By focusing on our breath and observing our mental state, we can begin to see our biases and prejudices more clearly. We can begin to understand why we have them and where they come from.

This is important because biases and prejudices can affect our relationships with others, our decision-making, and our overall well-being. They can cause us to make unfair assumptions, discriminate against certain groups, and even lead us to hold onto outdated beliefs.

By meditating on our biases and prejudices, we can learn to let go of them. We can learn to be more accepting of others and embrace diversity. We can also improve our decision-making by being more open-minded and less influenced by our biases.

It’s important to note that this is not an easy process. Recognizing our biases and prejudices can be uncomfortable and even painful. But it’s a necessary step in our personal growth and development. By doing the hard work of examining ourselves, we can become better people and make the world a better place.

In conclusion, meditation is a powerful tool for self-reflection and growth. By meditating on our biases and prejudices, we can become more aware of them and work towards overcoming them. This will not only improve our relationships with others but also make us better decision-makers and more well-rounded individuals.
