The cello has a rich, warm sound that is often described as being similar to the human voice. It has four strings tuned to C-G-D-A, with the lowest string, the C string, being the thickest and the highest string, the A string, being the thinnest. The strings are typically made of steel or gut, and are played with a bow made of horsehair or plucked with the fingers.

The cello has a long history, with early versions of the instrument dating back to the 16th century. It was originally used as a bass instrument in ensembles, but over time it became a popular solo instrument as well. Famous cellists throughout history include Pablo Casals, Yo-Yo Ma, and Jacqueline du Pr√©.
