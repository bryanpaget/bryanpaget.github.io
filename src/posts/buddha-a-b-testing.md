As a spiritual teacher, the Buddha did not directly address the concept of A/B testing or marketing practices. However, we can try to interpret this concept from a Buddhist perspective.

In Buddhist philosophy, there is an emphasis on non-attachment and the impermanence of all things. This includes material possessions and worldly achievements, such as the success of a product or advertisement. The Buddha taught that attachment to these things can lead to suffering, as all things are subject to change and ultimately, to decay.

From this perspective, the Buddha might caution against becoming too attached to the success of a particular version of a product or advertisement, recognizing that even the most successful outcome is impermanent and subject to change. However, he might also acknowledge the importance of using data-driven decision-making to minimize suffering for consumers and to promote efficiency in the marketplace.

In summary, while the Buddha did not directly address the concept of A/B testing, we can interpret it from a Buddhist perspective as a means of making data-driven decisions while recognizing the impermanence of material success.
