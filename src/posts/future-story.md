write a short story, cyber punk in theme, that indirectly protrays a world where: "people use bicycles, trains, driverless shuttles to get around, where education is the top priority, religion is not taken so seriously, science is just a tool not a dictatorship, where the corrupt no longer rule, where the white man is just one of many men"

The sun had set on the neon-lit cityscape as John made his way through the crowded streets on his bike. He had just finished his shift at the research lab where he worked on developing the latest advancements in clean energy technology. As he weaved his way through the sea of people and autonomous shuttles, he couldn't help but feel a sense of optimism for the future.

It had been decades since the world had shifted away from fossil fuels and towards sustainable energy, and the results were clear. Pollution had decreased, the climate was stabilizing, and people were living longer and healthier lives.

Religion had faded into the background, no longer serving as a divisive force. Instead, people were focused on education and scientific advancement, striving to push the boundaries of what was possible. The corrupt politicians and businessmen who had once held the world in their grip were now a distant memory, replaced by a new generation of leaders who prioritized the well-being of the planet and its inhabitants.

As John pedaled towards his home in the suburbs, passing by sleek and modern train stations, he couldn't help but feel grateful for the world he lived in. The white man, once seen as the dominant force, was now just one of many men and women of all races and backgrounds who worked together towards a common goal: a better future for all.

As he arrived at his doorstep, he took one last look at the world around him, knowing that it was up to each and every one of them to continue to strive towards progress and create the world they wanted to live in.
