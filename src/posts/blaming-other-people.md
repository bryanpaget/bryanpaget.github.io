The Buddha emphasized the importance of personal responsibility and the cultivation of self-awareness as the key to achieving happiness and success.

The Buddha taught that the root of suffering is attachment, which includes attachment to our own ideas of success and failure. He encouraged his followers to develop a clear understanding of the nature of their own minds and to take responsibility for their thoughts and actions.

In the Dhammapada, a collection of the Buddha's teachings, it is said: "As a solid rock is not shaken by the wind, even so the wise are not affected by praise or blame." This suggests that blaming others for our problems and lack of success is a futile and ultimately unproductive exercise. Instead, we must cultivate our own wisdom and inner strength in order to navigate life's challenges with equanimity and clarity.
