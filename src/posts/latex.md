description: Computer programming is an art, because it applies accumulated knowledge to the world, because it requires skill and ingenuity, and especially because it produces objects of beauty. A programmer who subconsciously views himself as an artist will enjoy what he does and will do it better (sic). &nbsp; &mdash; Donald Knuth

<h3>Why LaTeX</h3>

<p> LaTeX typesetting offers several advantages over Microsoft Word. Firstly, it produces higher quality documents with sharper fonts and better spacing. Secondly, it allows for easier management of large, complex documents, making it popular among academic and scientific communities. Thirdly, it is more customizable and allows for greater control over document formatting.</p>

<p>Furthermore, LaTeX is a free (as in freedom), open-source software that runs on multiple platforms, while Microsoft Word is a proprietary software that requires a license. LaTeX also has a wide range of packages and templates available, making it easy to create documents with specific formatting requirements.</p>

<p>In short, LaTeX is a more efficient and powerful tool for typesetting compared to Microsoft Word. I've included below some of the articles I've written and typeset in LaTeX, see for yourself!</p>
