<p>what is the goal of buddhism</p>
<p>The goal of Buddhism is to achieve enlightenment, which is a state of perfect wisdom and compassion that transcends the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth (known as samsara) and leads to liberation from suffering. This state is also known as Nirvana.</p>
<p>Buddhism teaches that suffering arises from craving, ignorance, and attachment to worldly desires and possessions. The goal of the Buddhist path is to overcome these obstacles and attain a state of clarity and wisdom that leads to liberation from suffering.</p>
<p>To achieve this goal, Buddhists practice the Eightfold Path, which includes right understanding, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. Through meditation, ethical conduct, and the cultivation of wisdom, Buddhists seek to overcome the roots of suffering and attain enlightenment.</p>
<p>It's important to note that there are many different schools of Buddhism, and different traditions may have different interpretations of the goal of Buddhism and the path to enlightenment. However, the fundamental goal of Buddhism is to overcome suffering and achieve enlightenment.</p>
