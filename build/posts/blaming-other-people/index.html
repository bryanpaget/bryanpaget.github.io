        <p>
            <em>As a solid rock is not shaken by the wind, even so the wise are not affected by praise or blame.</em>
        </p>

        <p>The Buddha emphasized the importance of personal responsibility and the cultivation of self-awareness as the key to achieving happiness and success.</p>
<p>The Buddha taught that the root of suffering is attachment, which includes attachment to our own ideas of success and failure. He encouraged his followers to develop a clear understanding of the nature of their own minds and to take responsibility for their thoughts and actions.</p>
<p>In the Dhammapada, a collection of the Buddha's teachings, it is said: &quot;As a solid rock is not shaken by the wind, even so the wise are not affected by praise or blame.&quot; This suggests that blaming others for our problems and lack of success is a futile and ultimately unproductive exercise. Instead, we must cultivate our own wisdom and inner strength in order to navigate life's challenges with equanimity and clarity.</p>
