        <p>
            <em>Puri is a city located in the eastern state of Odisha in India. It is located on the coast of the Bay of Bengal and is considered a significant pilgrimage center in India. The city has a rich history and culture that dates back several centuries.</em>
        </p>

        <p>Puri is a coastal city located in the eastern state of Odisha, India. It is famous for the Jagannath Temple, one of the most important Hindu temples in the country.</p>
<p>The Jagannath Temple is dedicated to Lord Jagannath, a form of Lord Vishnu, and is believed to have been built in the 12th century. The temple is an important pilgrimage site for Hindus, and is particularly significant for followers of the Vaishnava tradition.</p>
<p>The temple complex covers an area of over 400,000 square feet and includes several smaller shrines and temples, as well as a large kitchen that prepares food for thousands of pilgrims every day. The temple's main sanctum houses idols of Lord Jagannath, his brother Lord Balabhadra, and their sister Subhadra.</p>
<p>One of the most important festivals celebrated at the Jagannath Temple is the Rath Yatra, or Chariot Festival, which takes place every year in June or July. During the festival, large chariots carrying the idols of Lord Jagannath, Balabhadra, and Subhadra are pulled through the streets of Puri by thousands of devotees. The festival is attended by millions of people from around the world.</p>
<p>The Jagannath Temple is known for its unique rituals and customs, including the prohibition of certain foods and the use of special utensils and clothing. Non-Hindus are not allowed inside the temple complex, but can view the temple from a distance.</p>
<p>Puri itself is a popular tourist destination, known for its beautiful beaches and vibrant culture. The city is also home to several other important Hindu temples, as well as museums and art galleries showcasing the region's rich history and traditions.</p>
<p>The history of Puri can be traced back to the 3rd century BC when it was a part of the Kalinga kingdom. It was an important center of Buddhism during the reign of Emperor Ashoka. Over time, Puri became a significant center of Hinduism, and the Jagannath Temple, which is dedicated to Lord Jagannath, became the focal point of the city.</p>
<p>During the medieval period, Puri was ruled by various dynasties, including the Eastern Ganga dynasty, the Suryavanshi dynasty, and the Mughals. In the 16th century, the region came under the control of the Marathas, and in the 18th century, it was ruled by the British East India Company.</p>
<p>The city of Puri has a vibrant culture that is deeply rooted in Hinduism. The Jagannath Temple is the most important religious site in the city, and it attracts thousands of pilgrims every year. The city is also known for its annual Rath Yatra festival, during which the deities of the Jagannath Temple are taken out in a grand procession.</p>
<p>In addition to its religious significance, Puri is also known for its rich heritage and architecture. The city has several ancient temples, including the Sun Temple and the Gundicha Temple, which are renowned for their intricate carvings and artwork.</p>
<p>As for its future, Puri is expected to continue to grow as a popular tourist destination, with efforts being made to preserve its rich cultural heritage and promote sustainable tourism. However, the city also faces various challenges, including overdevelopment, pollution, and climate change, which could have a significant impact on its future.</p>
