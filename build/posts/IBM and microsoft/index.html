<p>Microsoft is one of the largest and most successful technology companies in the world. Founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen in 1975, Microsoft has been a dominant player in the personal computer industry for decades. In this blog post, we'll explore the history of Microsoft, including the controversial story of how Bill Gates allegedly cheated IBM.</p>
<p>The Early Days of Microsoft</p>
<p>Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded Microsoft in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in 1975. At the time, personal computers were just beginning to become popular, and Microsoft's mission was to create software for these new devices. One of Microsoft's early successes was creating the operating system for the IBM PC, which was released in 1981. This operating system, called MS-DOS, became the standard for personal computers, and it helped establish Microsoft as a major player in the technology industry.</p>
<p>The Allegations of Cheating IBM</p>
<p>The story of how Microsoft came to create the operating system for the IBM PC is controversial. According to some accounts, Bill Gates and Paul Allen cheated IBM out of millions of dollars by licensing an operating system that they didn't actually own.</p>
<p>The story goes like this: In 1980, IBM approached Microsoft with a request for an operating system for their upcoming personal computer. Microsoft didn't have an operating system at the time, so they purchased one from a small software company called Seattle Computer Products. The operating system, called QDOS (Quick and Dirty Operating System), was based on an earlier operating system called CP/M.</p>
<p>Microsoft made some modifications to QDOS and rebranded it as MS-DOS. They then licensed MS-DOS to IBM for use in their personal computers. The licensing agreement gave Microsoft the right to sell MS-DOS to other computer manufacturers, which allowed Microsoft to become a major player in the personal computer industry.</p>
<p>The controversy comes from the fact that Seattle Computer Products had purchased the rights to CP/M from its creator, Gary Kildall. Kildall was a pioneer in the personal computer industry, and he had created CP/M years before Microsoft had even been founded. Some have alleged that Microsoft should have paid Kildall for the rights to use CP/M, rather than purchasing the rights from Seattle Computer Products.</p>
<p>However, there are conflicting accounts of what actually happened. Some sources claim that IBM approached Kildall about licensing CP/M for their personal computer, but Kildall was out flying his plane at the time and didn't respond to IBM's request. When IBM contacted Microsoft, Gates and Allen were able to deliver an operating system to IBM in a timely manner, which is why IBM ultimately chose to license MS-DOS.</p>
<p>The Legacy of Microsoft</p>
<p>Regardless of the controversy surrounding the creation of MS-DOS, there's no denying that Microsoft went on to become a major player in the technology industry. Under Bill Gates' leadership, Microsoft created a range of popular software products, including the Windows operating system, the Office suite of productivity software, and the Internet Explorer web browser.</p>
<p>Today, Microsoft is one of the largest companies in the world, with a market capitalization of over $2 trillion. While the controversy surrounding the creation of MS-DOS will likely always be a part of Microsoft's history, there's no denying that the company has had a significant impact on the technology industry, and on the world as a whole.</p>
