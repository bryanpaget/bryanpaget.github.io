        <p>According to Buddhist teachings, the Buddha would emphasize the importance of developing one's own understanding and insight rather than blindly following the words of others or being swayed by persuasive speech. The Buddha encouraged his followers to seek the truth for themselves through personal experience and reflection.</p>
<p>Regarding insecurity and the desire for friendship, the Buddha would likely point to the importance of cultivating self-awareness and self-acceptance. In Buddhism, the ultimate goal is to reach a state of enlightenment or liberation, which requires letting go of attachment and aversion to external conditions, including the need for approval from others.</p>
<p>However, the Buddha did not teach that one should avoid social interaction or relationships altogether. Instead, he taught that the key to healthy relationships is to approach them with mindfulness and compassion, treating others with kindness and respect while also maintaining a sense of detachment and non-attachment.</p>
