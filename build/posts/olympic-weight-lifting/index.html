<p>Olympic weightlifting is a sport that involves lifting weights in two different disciplines: the snatch and the clean and jerk. Both exercises require the use of a barbell and weights.</p>
<p>The snatch is performed by lifting the barbell from the ground to an overhead position in one smooth motion. The athlete must lift the weight overhead with locked out arms, and then stand up straight to complete the lift. The snatch requires a great deal of speed, strength, and coordination, as well as excellent technique.</p>
<p>The clean and jerk is a two-part lift. In the first part, the athlete lifts the weight from the ground to their shoulders, using a motion known as the clean. In the second part, the athlete lifts the weight overhead, using a motion known as the jerk. Like the snatch, the clean and jerk requires a great deal of strength, speed, and coordination, and it also requires a high level of technical proficiency.</p>
<p>Olympic weightlifting is a highly technical and demanding sport that requires years of dedicated training to master. Competitors are judged on their ability to lift the heaviest weight possible in each of the two lifts, and the winner is the athlete who lifts the most weight overall. It is a sport that requires not only physical strength, but also mental toughness, focus, and discipline.</p>
