<h1 class='postTitle'>Gender Identity</h1>
    <p>
    <em>It is true that gender dysphoria has likely existed throughout human history, but the social and cultural context in which it is experienced and understood has evolved over time.</em>
    </p>
    <p>The concept of gender identity as we understand it today is a relatively modern development, and the language and social structures used to describe and categorize gender have changed over time. In some cultures, individuals who did not conform to traditional gender norms may have been recognized as &quot;two-spirit&quot; or &quot;third gender,&quot; and their experiences were understood in the context of cultural beliefs and practices.</p>
<p>In other cultures, gender non-conformity was viewed as deviant or pathological, and individuals who expressed gender variance may have faced stigma, discrimination, or violence. It is only relatively recently that Western medicine and psychology have developed a clinical diagnosis of gender dysphoria to describe the distress experienced by individuals whose gender identity differs from the sex they were assigned at birth.</p>
<p>In this sense, it is not that people are experiencing gender dysphoria now but not before, but rather that the social and cultural context in which gender is understood and experienced has changed over time, which has influenced how individuals express and understand their gender identity.</p>
