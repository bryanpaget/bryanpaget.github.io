<p>what would the buddha say about gender dysphoria

<p>The Buddha taught that suffering arises from attachment and clinging to a fixed sense of self, which can include identification with one's gender. Thus, the goal in Buddhism is to transcend the limitations of the self and attain liberation from suffering.</p>
<p>In the context of gender dysphoria, the Buddha might advise individuals to cultivate mindfulness and self-awareness, exploring the sources of their suffering and striving to develop greater acceptance and compassion for themselves and others.</p>
