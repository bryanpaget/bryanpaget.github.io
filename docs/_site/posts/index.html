                The cello is a stringed musical instrument that is part of the violin family. It is played by sitting down with the instrument between the player&#39;s legs, with the body of the cello resting on the floor and the neck and scroll extending upwards. The cello is held against the player&#39;s chest and supported by a spike that extends from the bottom of the instrument.

                The area that is now Toronto has been inhabited for thousands of years by Indigenous peoples, including the Huron-Wendat, Anishinaabe, and Haudenosaunee peoples. In the 17th century, French traders and explorers began to establish trading posts in the area, and in 1750, the British took control of the region. The city of Toronto was officially incorporated in 1834, and it grew rapidly in the 19th and 20th centuries to become a major economic and cultural hub.

                Meditation allows us to become more aware of our thoughts and feelings. By focusing on our breath and observing our mental state, we can begin to see our biases and prejudices more clearly. We can begin to understand why we have them and where they come from.

                <p class="small">

                Yoga is a practice that originated in ancient India around 5000 years ago. It is a holistic practice that includes physical postures, breath control, meditation, and ethical principles. Yoga was originally intended to be a tool for spiritual and mental development, and was practiced primarily by ascetics and monks.

                <p class="small">

                The Buddha might appreciate the idea of open source, as it embodies the principle of generosity and encourages sharing and collaboration without the constraints of ownership or profit. By freely sharing code and knowledge, individuals can work together to create something greater than what they could achieve alone, and can contribute to the greater good of society.

                The area that is now Vancouver has been inhabited for thousands of years by Indigenous peoples, including the Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Waututh nations. European settlement began in the late 19th century, and Vancouver was incorporated as a city in 1886. It grew rapidly in the early 20th century, particularly after the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914, which made Vancouver a major port for trade with Asia.

                Photography is much more than just capturing images of the world around us. It is the art of capturing photons, the particles of light that make up everything we see. Photography is a way of seeing the world and capturing moments in time that we may otherwise miss. In this post, we will explore the mindfulness of photography and how it can help us stay optimistic and appreciative of the beauty around us.

Aikido techniques are based on circular movements, joint locks, throws, and pins.

                Statistical bias occurs when there is a systematic deviation from the true value in a sample. In other words, bias occurs when the sample used to draw conclusions is not representative of the population it’s meant to represent.
