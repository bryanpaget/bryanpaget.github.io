<p>The cello is a stringed musical instrument that is part of the violin family. It is played by sitting down with the instrument between the player's legs, with the body of the cello resting on the floor and the neck and scroll extending upwards. The cello is held against the player's chest and supported by a spike that extends from the bottom of the instrument.</p>

<p>The cello has a rich, warm sound that is often described as being similar to the human voice. It has four strings tuned to C-G-D-A, with the lowest string, the C string, being the thickest and the highest string, the A string, being the thinnest. The strings are typically made of steel or gut, and are played with a bow made of horsehair or plucked with the fingers.</p>
